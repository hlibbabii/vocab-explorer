## Vocab explorer roadmap

- create vocab from workspace symbols if .vocab is not found and save to .vocab; populate the view from .vocab file 
- apply nlp
- remove non asci
- on file save highlight new sidentifiers that are not in .vocab, suggest to replace with existing vocab if there synonyms if not suggest adding to vocab.
- filter garbage files
- on selection in view, show where in workspace it occurs 
- create gif
- setup linter and shit
- js tokens ad typescript type declarations

Vocab experiment only with identifiers:
does removing non-existing words, lematizing, removing synonyms help?
